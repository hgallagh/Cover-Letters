\section{Me just being me}
I really like optics, lasers, and astrophysics. I play piano, violin. I acknowledge my mistakes. I was hell bent on getting through undergrad debt free that I transferred schools for the scholarship and astrophysics program that works with the LIGO collaboration. I'm so cool I've been bothering astrophysicists and optics scientists for eight years now <3.
